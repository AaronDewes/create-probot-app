# Create Probot App

This project will generate a new [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) app 
with everything you need to get started and run your app in production.

If you're using npm: 

```sh
npx create-probot-app my-first-app
```

If you're using Yarn: 

```sh
yarn create probot-app my-first-app
```

Or add `--typescript` to generate a new TypeScript project:

NPM:
```sh
npx create-probot-app --typescript my-first-app
```
Yarn:

```sh
yarn create probot-app --typescript my-first-app
```
